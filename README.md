# qam
Library to compute 3D surface-distances between max. 3 binary segmentation images.

We used an adapted Dice Soerensen coefficient to evaluate the ablation completness in treating liver tumors. Out quantitative ablation margin (QAM) calculation is illustrated  in the next figure. The output is an array of 3D surface distances that can also be visualized as traffic-light colored histogram (see last step in the pipeline).
